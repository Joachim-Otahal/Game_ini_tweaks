# Game .ini tweaks
Ini tweaks for some games to get more visual quality

## ge3.ini
Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition. The presets for high and very high are adjusted to be actually high and very high by todays (i.e. year 2022) standards.
Changed are: View distances and LOD settings.
Copy to "ini" subfolder in your installation folder, in my case "G:\Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods EE\Ini"

Sadly: The game lacks in the gameplay departement. You can steal nearly everywhere everything. Fighting groups of enemies is way too simple, since they give up following you way too soo and you will only have to kill one or two instead of 10 or more. The voice acting is messed up, first talking about  how bad an evil everything is and suddenly switch to the "oh, such a nice day" tone. Not enough sidequests, some of them with no hint to go somewhere, too many of them broken and so on.
